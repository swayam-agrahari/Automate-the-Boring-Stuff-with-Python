1. What is []?
-->The value [] is an empty list that contains no values, similar to '', the empty string.

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
-->spam.insert(2, 'hello')

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
-->d

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
-->d

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
-->['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
--> 1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
-->[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
-->[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
-->List concatination- '+' and list replication- '*'

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
-->The append() list method call adds the argument to the end of the list whereas the insert() method can insert a value at any index in the list.

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
--> remove(), del

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
--> Both string and list supports indexing, slicing, in loops, using len() , in and not in operators 

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
--> List are mutable but tuples aren't i.e they cannot have their values modified, appended, or removed.

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
--> span=(42,)	

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
--> tuple form of a list-- tuple(['cat', 'dog']) and list form of tuple--> list(('pewdipie', 'harry',))

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
--> They contain refrences of the list item itself.

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
-->copy.copy() is be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary whereas  copy.deepcopy() will copy the list contains too.
