1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
   --> Two values: True, False. We write them by making the first letter capital and the other as lowercase. (T/F)

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
   --> The three Boolean operators are: and, or, not.

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
   True  or True   --> True
   True  or False  --> True
   False or True   --> True
   False or False  --> False

   True  and True   --> True
   True  and False  --> False
   False and True   --> False
   False and False  --> False

   not True   --> False
   not False  --> True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
   - (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                  --> False
   - not (5 > 4)                           --> False	
   - (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                   --> True
   - not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))             --> False
   - (True and True) and (True == False)   --> False
   - (not False) or (not True)             --> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
   --> They are: >, <, ==, >=, <=, !=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
   --> The equal to operator is used to compare both values left and right to it, whereas the assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
   --> A condition is an expression that evaluates to True or False. We use conditions when we want to perform certain actions based on the condition itself.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
   spam = 0
   if spam == 10:      # block-01
       print('eggs')
       if spam > 5:     # block-02
           print('bacon')
       else:            # block-03
           print('ham')
       print('spam')
   print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

print("Enter value for spam")
spam = int(input())
if(spam == 1):
  print("Hello")
elif(spam == 2):
  print("Howdy")
else:
  print("Greetings!")

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

ctrl + c

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

Break is used to break the iteration and terminate the loop, whereas continue is used to skip that iteration.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

- `range(10)` has a default starting value of 0 and a step of 1.
- `range(0, 10)` explicitly specifies the starting value (0) and has a default step of 1.
- `range(0, 10, 1)` explicitly specifies the starting value (0), ending value (10), and step (1).

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# Using for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
   print(i)

# Using while loop
i = 1
while(i <= 10):
  print(i)
  i += 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
--> spam.bacon()
